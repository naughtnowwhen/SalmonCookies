    <h1>Here at salmoncookies.com, we believe Salmon belong in cookies.</h1>

<!-- borrowed from WIkipedia -->
    <h2>But that wasn't always our sincerely held belief.</h2>

    <h3>Out of respect, let's learn a little about these wonderful fish. </h3>

    <p id="p1"> Learning about salmon led us down the long and winding path to the epiphany that salmon belong in cookies. </p> 

    <p id="p2"> Folklore has it that the fish return to the exact spot where they hatched to spawn; tracking studies have shown this to be mostly true. A portion of a returning salmon run may stray and spawn in different freshwater systems. The percent of straying depends on the species of salmon. Homing behavior has been shown to depend on olfactory memory.</p>

    <p id="p3">The term "salmon" comes from the Latin salmo, which in turn might have originated from salire, meaning "to leap".</p>
